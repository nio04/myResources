git stash hide our works from staged & unstaged area. so that we can switch to another branch, without having to worry about, conflict warning or unstaged works follow to another branch

when we add works in a branch and if we switch to another branch before commit.two things will happen

1/ if no conflict was found :: the new works will be follow to the switched branch

2/ if conflict was found :: git wont let me switch branch



////////
when no conflict were found ::
if there were no conflict and unstaged works exist. then when we switch branch, our unstaged works follow the branch. to prevent this 

##//to stash
## git stash
##//to unstash
## git stash pop

// note :: the following works on branch is not permanent. when we commit the works from our working branch, all the follow up works will be gone!!!


////////
when conflict found ::
we dont want to commit our current works but wanting to switch branch 

## //to stash changes
## git stash
## //to unstash changes
## git stash pop
