parent container :
------------
flex direction : row[] row-revers ecolumn column-reverse

flex-wrap : nowrap [] wrap wrap-reverse

justify-content : flex-start [] flex-end start end left right center space-between space-around space-evenly
=> works on main axis (x)

align-items : stretch [] flex-start flex-end start self-start end self-end center baseline
=> works on cross axis (y) || baseline : items are aligned such as their baselines align

align-content : normal [] flex-start flex-end start end space-between space-around space-evenly stretch
=> only works if the contents in multi-line. works in cross axis (y) between row gap

gap : [row gap] [column gap]
